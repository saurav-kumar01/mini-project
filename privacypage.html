                Smart Transfer is fully GDPR compliant (The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is legislation that updated and unified data privacy laws across the European Union (EU). GDPR was approved by the European Parliament on April 14, 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018.), as your data is never stored anywhere.

                Even though we do our utmost best to make our platform as secure as possible, your security is still your own responsibility. The share links are meant to be private, so use them as such.
